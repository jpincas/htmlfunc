Functional HTML Library for Go

A library to help you write HTML layouts as regular Go functions, rather than using a template.

Heavily inspired by the way Elm does HTML output - in fact, bar a few tweaks to help suit Go's syntax a bit better, it's almost identical.

Currently being developed on an 'as needed' basis, so please feel free to add missing elements if you want/need them.
